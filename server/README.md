## Setup

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all the requirements are properly installed.


## Database
The file `database/dbmanager.py` contains a bunch of helper methods to interact with the database. A nice program to use for looking at sql dbs is [DB Browser For SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

### Setting up the DB

```
python dbmanager.py create_db
```
This deletes the `sqlite` file and recreates the database from scratch

### Inputting fake data
```
python dbmanager.py add_users
python dbmanager.py add_chats
```
These set up fake users and three chats. The data it uses is in some Excel files in `database/data/`.

### Sending Messages
```
python dbmanager.py add_messages
```
This will start a loop requesting the following information (the timestamp is autogenerated):

```
Chat Id: 
Your ID: 
Timestamp: 2022-03-01 11:16:37.333391
Message:
Press enter to send
```

You can obtain the `chat_id` from the excel sheets, or by looking in the DB

### Querying the db
Currently you can only query the database using 
```
python dbmanager.py get_messages
```
This requests a `chat_id` and will then outpt all the messages from that chat, ordered by time.
